% This is where the header to the file would be.
% Instructions for the code file would be here.

% You can assign variables with the = sign

a = 2;

b = 14;

% Rules of naming variables:
% - must begin with a letter
% - must contain only letters, numbers, or underscores.
% Variables don't need to be named according to their purpose but it helps if you do so, for example:

a = 378;
b = 60;

c = a/b;

disp(c);

% does exactly the same thing as:

cars_spotted = 378;

minutes = 60;

rate = cars_spotted/minutes;

disp(rate);

% In both cases the computer reads the scripts in exactly the same way, but in the latter it's easier for the user to read it, so this is preferable.
